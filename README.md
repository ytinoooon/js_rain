   1. Why I created it?:
        1. Because I was bored;
        1. Because I wanted to learn;
        1. Because I wanted to learn p5.js;
        1. Because I saw this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkyIDI6rQJI&t=48s);
    
   1. As I told you this project is made by the help of the javascript library called p5.js (https://p5js.org/).
   1. And I was inspired by Daniel Shiffman the creator of the Youtube channel and website called Coding Train

   1. The time of makeing this project I am 15 years old and not very well experienced by any means in programing.

   1. The features I want and will try to add:
        1. A UI for chosing shapes and colors
        1. Add shapes: 
          1. Triangles
          1. Quadrilaterals
          1. Pentagons
          1. Hexagons
        1.  And some more color palets
            
   You actually can change the shapes and colors in the sketch.js
