   # Hey this project is a satisfying cmatrix wannabe.

   [ THE DEMO TO THE REPO  <- CLICK](https://ytinoooon.github.io/js_rain/index.html)

    Why I created it?:
        - Because I was bored;
        - Because I wanted to learn;
        - Because I wanted to learn p5.js;
        - Because I saw this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkyIDI6rQJI&t=48s);

    As I told you this project is made by the help of the javascript library called p5.js (https://p5js.org/).
    And I was inspired by Daniel Shiffman the creator of the Youtube channel and website called Coding Train

    The time of makeing this project I am 15 years old and not very well experienced by any means in programing.

    The features I want and will try to add:
        -   A UI for chosing shapes and colors (done)
        -   Make shapes more apealing
        -   Compatible other screens
        -   Add shapes: 
            - Triangles
            - Quadrilaterals
            - Pentagons
            - Hexagons
        -   And some more color palets

    You actually can change the shapes and colors in the sketch.js
