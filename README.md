   # Hey this project is a satisfying cmatrix wannabe.
    
   [THE DEMO OF THE REPO](https://ytinoooon.github.io/js_rain/index.html)
    
   Why I created it?:
        - Because I was bored;
        - Because I wanted to learn;
        - Because I wanted to learn p5.js;
        - Because I saw this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkyIDI6rQJI&t=48s);
    
   As I told you this project is made by the help of the javascript library called p5.js (https://p5js.org/).
   And I was inspired by Daniel Shiffman the creator of the Youtube channel and website called Coding Train

   The time of makeing this project I am 15 years old and not very well experienced by any means in programing.

   The features I want and will try to add:
        1. A UI for chosing shapes and colors
        1. Add shapes: 
             * Triangles
             * Quadrilaterals
             * Pentagons
             * Hexagons
        1.  And some more color palets
            
   You actually can change the shapes and colors in the sketch.js
