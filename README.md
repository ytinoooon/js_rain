   # Hey this project is a satisfying cmatrix wannabe.

   [ THE DEMO TO THE REPO  <- CLICK](https://ytinoooon.github.io/js_rain/index.html)

1. Why I created it?:
    Because I was bored;
    Because I wanted to learn;
    Because I wanted to learn p5.js;
    Because I saw this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkyIDI6rQJI&t=48s);
---
2. As I told you this project is made by the help of the javascript library called p5.js (https://p5js.org/).
3. And I was inspired by Daniel Shiffman the creator of the Youtube channel and website called Coding Train
